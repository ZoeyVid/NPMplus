# Changelog

All notable changes to the NPMplus Security Fork are documented here. The fork uses release identifiers based on the bundled NPMplus version followed by a fork-specific sequence.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Restored upstream NPMplus runtime Certbot DNS-plugin installation so Cloudflare and other DNS challenges work out of the box; pinned pip and Certbot stay in the image and the pip packaging-tool scan findings are carried under a reviewed, expiring `.trivy/npmplus.yaml` baseline.

## v2.15.1-mangyan1.rc.2 - 2026-09-05

Second public release candidate of the security-focused fork.

### Fixed

- Repaired fresh Anubis honeypot file mounts and native CrowdSec conflict handling.
- Made Docker startup wait for usable DNS and corrected LAN-only administrator access through the host listener.
- Simplified private-LAN installer questions and made host-networking guidance clearer.

### Changed

- Added explicit per-host Anubis protection controls and left the global catch-all challenge off by default for API, webhook, and licensing compatibility.
- Reduced the frontend entry bundle from about 1.05 MB to 463 KB by splitting the CrowdSec attack map and importing only supported locale flags.
- Clarified version-pinned release installation before the rolling `develop` channel.

### Security

- Kept CrowdSec community protection enabled while showing remote blocklist entries only as aggregate dashboard metrics.
- Moved GoAccess executable code to administrator-protected same-origin assets, removed executable inline-script permission, and disabled caching of report data.
- Filtered documented, expiring upstream container exceptions out of open SARIF alerts without weakening the failing vulnerability gate.

## v2.15.1-mangyan1.rc.1 - 2026-09-04

First public release candidate of the security-focused fork.

### Added

- One-command interactive installation and maintenance for Debian and Ubuntu.
- Transactional updates with health checks, rollback snapshots, daily backups, reboot diagnostics, and CrowdSec credential repair.
- CrowdSec AppSec, firewall-bouncer, Anubis, and honeypot integrations with dashboard monitoring.
- A compact security dashboard with local alerts, local bans, attack geography, engine health, AppSec metrics, and protected manual actions.
- Fork-owned multi-architecture release images, SBOM/provenance attestations, exact-image vulnerability gates, and checksum-protected installer assets.

### Security

- Loopback-only administration and security-service listeners by default.
- Temporary administrator bootstrap secrets instead of credentials stored in Compose.
- Digest-pinned deployment images and reviewed, expiring vulnerability exceptions for unmodified upstream components.
- Hardened session, browser, API, container, and host-maintenance defaults.

### Changed

- Documentation and project website are focused on a simple reverse-proxy and security appliance workflow.
- PHP-FPM deployment is intentionally left to the proxied application stacks.
